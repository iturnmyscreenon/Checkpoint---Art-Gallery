## Concept

Our online art gallery aims to provide an accessible platform for art lovers worldwide to discover and purchase works from talented artists. We believe that art should be accessible to everyone and our platform is designed to facilitate this discovery by offering a simple and intuitive user experience.

## Project

The online art gallery project is developed in React JS to offer a fast and smooth experience for users. The platform is designed to be easy to use and navigate, with a clear and attractive interface

for displaying art works. Users can easily browse through different art categories, perform searches, and add works to their shopping cart with just a few clicks.

## Setup & Use

### Project Initialization

- In VSCode, install plugins **Prettier - Code formatter** and **ESLint** and configure them
- Clone this repo, enter it
- Run command `npm run setup`
- _NB: To launch the backend server, you'll need an environment file with database credentials. You'll find a template one in `backend/.env.sample`_

### Available Commands

- `setup` : Initialization of frontend and backend, as well as all toolings
- `migrate` : Run the database migration script
- `dev` : Starts both servers (frontend + backend) in one terminal
- `dev-front` : Starts the React frontend server
- `dev-back` : Starts the Express backend server
- `lint` : Runs validation tools, and refuses unclean code (will be executed on every _commit_)
- `fix` : Fixes linter errors (run it if `lint` growls on your code !)

## FAQ

### Tools

- _Concurrently_ : Allows for several commands to run concurrently in the same CLI
- _Husky_ : Allows to execute specific commands that trigger on _git_ events
- _Vite_ : Alternative to _Create-React-App_, packaging less tools for a more fluid experience
- _ESLint_ : "Quality of code" tool, ensures chosen rules will be enforced
- _Prettier_ : "Quality of code" tool as well, focuses on the styleguide
- _ Airbnb Standard_ : One of the most known "standards", even though it's not officially linked to ES/JS
- _Nodemon_ : Allows to restart the server everytime a .js file is udated
